# Real-Time Incident Monitoring & Automated Escalation System for TOC

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing technical operations workflows by implementing a real-time incident tracking system. It automates escalation handling, reduces downtime, and improves response time for Level II support teams.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Query optimization, issue tracking
- **Python**: Data processing, automation
- **Power BI**: Visualization of issue resolution trends
- **Databricks**: Data pipeline management
- **Airflow**: Workflow automation

## Key Features
✅ Automated SQL-based issue tracking system  
✅ Power BI dashboard for real-time incident monitoring  
✅ Python scripts for predictive maintenance  
✅ Escalation workflows to prioritize system failures  

## Setup & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KVSSNIRUPAM/Technical-Operations-TOC-Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Database Setup:**
- Open the `incident_tracking.sql` file and execute the queries in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.

3. **Running the Python Script:**
- Ensure you have Python installed (`python --version`).
- Install dependencies using:
  ```
  pip install pandas numpy
  ```
- Run the script:
  ```
  python predictive_analysis.py
  ```

4. **Power BI Dashboard:**
- Open `Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI.
- Connect it to your SQL database for real-time analysis.
